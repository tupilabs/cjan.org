# CJAN

CJAN - Comprehensive Java Archive Network - was created after Perl's CPAN. It 
allows developers to register modules, write documentation and upload tests. 

## Module compatibility with different platforms

With a command line tool or via the web interface, CJAN testers can upload the 
test results to the website. It also includes information about JVM and Operating 
System. 

This way, other developers can know beforehand whether a Java module (API, library, 
tool, server, program, etc) works with his desired environments.

## Simple infrastructure

Different than java.net, CJAN.org has no intention of hosting projects, source 
code management systems, or bug tracking tools. Similarly to CPAN, in CJAN 
each module documentation will point to the source code repository (hosted somewhere 
else, like GitHub, SourceForge.net, GoogleCode), bug tracking tool, web site, etc.

This way projects won't have to change to be part in CJAN, and it gets easier to 
administrate the whole environment and avoid outages.

## Content

The content in CJAN will be simple too, taking advantage of websites like 
Reddit, where users can post links, share, comment and vote. 

CJAN content management will be similar to DZone and Reddit - collaborative.

## License

The whole project will be licensed under a permissive license. The goal will be 
gather a community around the project, and create a board. Then proceed and 
donate the project to an organization like SPI.

Pretty much like Jenkins, the idea is have a community roled by meritocracy, 
and make sure that the project continue free, useful, stable and fun to 
use/learn/share/participate.
